# About this project
This is based on the the Microsoft [dev-box](https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts) setup scripts, but for my own personal machine

# What this does

Sets default explorer settings:

* Show hidden files
* Show protected OS files

* Adds things back in your left pane like recycle bin
* Opens PC to This PC, not quick access
* Taskbar where window is open for multi-monitor
